Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that allows peer-to-peer transactions without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government. It was introduced in 2008 by an anonymous individual or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.
Key Features
Decentralization: Operates on a peer-to-peer network of computers (nodes).

Blockchain Technology: Transactions are recorded on a public ledger (the blockchain).

Limited Supply: There will only ever be 21 million bitcoins.

Mining: New bitcoins are created through a process called mining, where powerful computers solve complex problems.

Pseudonymity: Users are identified by alphanumeric addresses, not names.

Security: Based on cryptographic principles; once a transaction is confirmed, it's nearly impossible to alter.
